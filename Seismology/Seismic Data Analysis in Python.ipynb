    "# Seismic Data Analysis in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://ds.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/\" target=\"_blank\">Seismic Analysis Code</a> is a commonly used software in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics\" target=\"_blank\">geophysics</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology\" target=\"_blank\">seismology</a> to analyze seismographs. As a result, many seismographs are stored as `.sac` files, which were created specifically for Seismic Analysis Code usage. In Python, the <a href=\"https://docs.obspy.org\" target=\"_blank\">ObsPy</a> package is commonly used to analyze the seismic data stored in `.sac` files. However, despite its popularity and functionality, ObsPy at the time of writing does not directly support the conversion of .sac file data into Numpy arrays or Pandas DataFrames. This direct lack of Numpy and Pandas support was the main reason for the creation of this set of seismic analysis codes in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The codes can be found in my <a href=\"https://github.com/natsunoyuki/seismic_analysis_tools/blob/main/sac_tools/Sac.py\" target=\"_blank\">Github repository</a>, and the Jupyter notebook containing notes on its usage can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/natsunoyuki/seismic_analysis_tools/blob/main/Sac_demo.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. In this post we will go through the main functionalities of <a href=\"https://github.com/natsunoyuki/seismic_analysis_tools/blob/main/sac_tools/Sac.py\" target=\"_blank\">Sac.py</a> in my Github repository."

    "## Seismograph Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "A seismograph is essentially a time series, and a time series can be represented in real time domain or in complex frequency domain. A similar concept occurs in quantum mechanics where a particle's wave function can be represented either in position space or momentum space. Therefore, the main idea of the Sac class in Sac.py is to contain .sac file data in both time and frequency domains."

    "\n",
    "In order to use the `Sac` class, we first have to import it from <a href=\"https://github.com/natsunoyuki/seismic_analysis_tools/blob/main/sac_tools/Sac.py\" target=\"_blank\">Sac.py</a> as shown in the code below. We can then create a `Sac` object to contain the loaded `.sac` file data, which can be plotted as a time series. We also load a separate data file containing the seismometer's response. Note that since the `.sac` data I work with only have 1 trace per file, I have crafted `Sac.py` around this restriction. The code can be easily modified to contain multiple traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the demonstration below, we explore the 5 main functions of the `Sac` class:\n",
    "1. Loading and visualizing `.sac` seismogram data.\n",
    "2. Trimming the loaded seismogram data.\n",
    "3. Performing Fourier transforms on the data.\n",
    "4. Visualizing the data's spectrogram.\n",
