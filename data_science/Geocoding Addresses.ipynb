    "# Geocoding Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of address data comes in the form of a string which is generally not directly usable by machine learning models. Therefore one important task data scientists face when handling geospatial data is the conversion of addresses to a numerical form which can then be used by machine learning models. This conversion is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_geocoding\" target=\"_blank\">geocoding</a>, and converts an address in string format to its geographical coordinates. For example, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House\" target=\"_blank\">White House</a>'s address at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW geocodes to 38°53′51.7189″N, 77°02′11.5913″W. \n",
    "\n",
    "The <a href=\"https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#nominatim\" target=\"_blank\">geopy</a> library is one of the more well known libraries for geocoding addresses in Python, although strictly speaking, geopy is simply a client which accesses the geocoding web services of third party providers. When using geopy, a geocoding web service such as <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Google Maps</a> or <a href=\"https://nominatim.org\" target=\"_blank\">Nominatim</a> must therefore be selected. Unfortunately, not all geocoding web services are provided for free, or have various restrictions such as daily limits for non-paying users. For this blog post, we will use <a href=\"https://nominatim.org\" target=\"_blank\">Nominatim</a>'s geocoding services which sets a strict limit of not more than 1 request per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Nominatim's geocoding web service using geopy is not too difficult, simply call `Nominatim()` from `geopy.geocoders`, specifying explicitly `user_agent` in the arguments. If `user_agent` is not explicitly specified, 403 or 429 HTTP errors might result due to violations to Nominatim's <a href=\"https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/\" target=\"_blank\">use policy</a>."
