    "Most scientists and engineers will encounter periodic data at some point of time in their careers. Common examples include hourly people and <a href=\"https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data\" target=\"_blank\">vehicle flow</a> in a particular part of a city and <a href=\"https://data.gov.sg/dataset/rainfall-monthly-number-of-rain-days\" target=\"_blank\">climate measurements</a> for a particular geographic location. Although one can use certain tricks to deal with periodic data using machine learning methods, a more classical approach exists. This classical approach is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform\" target=\"_blank\">Fourier transform</a> and is widely used in physics and engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier transform essentially converts a particular signal from time domain to frequency domain. If any periodic signals are present in the main signal, they will become obvious in the frequency domain. As the Fourier transform is originally defined for continuous signals, when dealing with discretely measured signals (i.e. every single signal measured digitally), we use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform\" target=\"_blank\">discrete Fourier transform</a> instead."

Instead of using a nested for loop to iterate through all time steps _k_, we observe that the equations above are actually dot products between the two vectors _X_ and `np.exp(1j * 2 * np.pi * K * n / N)`. By doing this, we gain a huge speed up in the calculation time as we do not need to execute the nested for loop.\n",

Note that in general, Fourier transforms should be conducted on signals with lengths of powers of 2, such as 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 elements. This is because the vast majority of dft packages are optimized for calculations involving powers of 2.\n",

    "Coding the discrete Fourier transform is a good way to understand what goes on under the hood, but for most purposes you should use packages that have been well optimized (and debugged) for speed. Such packages include `scipy.fft` and `numpy.fft` for Python, and `fft` for GNU Octave. I hope this post has provided some insight into the discrete Fourier transform and its uses. "
