Most useful applications require solving the system in at least 2 dimensions. However, to make everything complete we also need to take a look at the 3 dimensional solver which is what we will do in this post. If you haven't yet, I recommend reading the previous 2 posts for more information about the fundamentals."

    "As with the 1D and 2D numerical discretisation schemes, we set _ħ_ = _m_ = 1 in order to simplify things. Also, we scale the energies _V_ and _E_ by a factor of 2. The 3 dimensional discretized equation takes on the form below.\n",

    "Note that _dx_, _dy_ and _dz_ are the numerical derivative step sizes for _x_, _y_ and _z_ respectively. However in such a discretized form, the wave function __Ψ__ becomes a 3 dimensional matrix with 3 indices _n_, _m_ and _l_. From a numerical eigenvalue solver standpoint, this is unacceptable as we want to solve for the system’s eigen energies and eigen wave functions which requires __Ψ__ to be in the form of a 1 dimensional vector. As with the 2 dimensional case, we use Kronecker products to combine the 3 one dimensional Hilbert spaces for _x_, _y_ and _z_ together to form a single three dimensional Hilbert space. The code used to generate the 3 dimensional Hamiltonian and solve for its eigenvalues is provided below."
